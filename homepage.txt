    <h1>How To Make Games</h1>
  <p>Nowadays computer games are becoming more and more entertaining, realistic, interactive, complex, creative
and sophisticated. The virtual reality games’ era is fast approaching due to progressive graphics, 3D and sound
effects, internet connectivity that makes it possible to play with people around the world, modern interaction
devices and other IT know-how used in their development. In 2013 Sony released
the PlayStation 4 focusing on social game play available with a new share button
and second screen gaming that can be connected to a smartphone. The same year
Xbox  released  cloud  integrated  Xbox  One  that  can  overlay  live TV.  The mobile
games  market  is  still  increasingly  growing.  Following  the  success  of  the  Apple
Store Android phones opened their Marketplace as well and a huge number of
games could be downloaded on the mobile devices or tablets.</p>

    <p>This game is called “Dragon Realm”. The player is on an Island of dragons. The dragons live in different caves
with their treasure. The friendly dragon will share their treasure with you. The other dragon is hungry and
will gobble up the player when they enter the cave. The player is standing in front of two caves, one with a
friendly dragon and the other with a hungry dragon and they must choose between the two caves.Practice running through how the game works step by step as you play it, as we will be looking at the
different stages to designing this game next.When designing a game, it is very helpful to write down everything you would like your game to do before to
start writing the code. A flow chart is useful tool that allows you to see a clear picture of all the possible
actions, options or steps in your game and where they will lead. This section will describe in detail how the
flow chart links to the actions of the game as it progresses.</p>

  <h1>Introduction to Animation</h1>
  <p>What’s the first thing that pops into your head when you hear the word ‘animation’? Cartoons, of course!
Cartoons and indeed animation have come a long way since the creation of the first iconic characters like Betty
Boop, Popeye the Sailor and Daffy Duck  during the 1930’s. Nowadays we have companies like Disney, Pixar
and DreamWorks, producing full length animated movies which have become classics and loved by viewers of
all ages. Some of the most successful films include Shrek, Toy Story, The Lion King and Finding Nemo. To see
just how much advancement has taken place, click below to watch the first animated film ever made. </p>
