    <h1>Introduction to Animation</h1>
    <p>What’s the first thing that pops into your head when you hear the word ‘animation’? Cartoons, of course!
  Cartoons and indeed animation have come a long way since the creation of the first iconic characters like Betty
  Boop, Popeye the Sailor and Daffy Duck  during the 1930’s. Nowadays we have companies like Disney, Pixar
  and DreamWorks, producing full length animated movies which have become classics and loved by viewers of
  all ages. Some of the most successful films include Shrek, Toy Story, The Lion King and Finding Nemo. To see
  just how much advancement has taken place, click below to watch the first animated film ever made. </p>
